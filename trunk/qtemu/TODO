-----------------------
The QtEmu TODO List:
-----------------------


-----------------
Known Bugs:
-----------------
Known bugs must be fixed before the next release.

* crash when using more than one tab, stopping the machine and returning to a previous tab: appears to be related to kde bugzilla http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160728 since we use the KRDC vnc code.

* when QtEMU crashes, KVM or QEMU usually keeps running. right now we can't reconnect to these already running processes. we should be able to do that when one is detected, possibly on startup.

* trying to start a machine that is already running from a previous crash results in a bind() failure from qemu when using the embedded viewer. this means the port it is trying to use for vnc is already in use.

* the preview screenshot may not be handled correctly when it is a different aspect ratio than the preview window. it should display in the correct aspect ratio, centered in the preview window, rather than stretched.

* sound errors need to be supressed after they are shown once. perhaps a better way of making sound actually work when using other apps?

------------------
Additional features:
------------------
These are planned future features for QtEmu.
------------------
Version 2.0:
------------------
* Embedded full screen view

* UI changes to make things less cluttered and more clear. also allow the addition of more options without confusion. (in the already existing settings tab)

* working network configuration.

* allow sending special keys

-------------------
Version 2.1 +:
-------------------
* information about the virtual machnine in a box below the screen preview (Image size / size on disk, memory, processor usage info for running machines, etc.).

* disconnect from a running machine. this would allow running a machine while qemu is closed. 

* the preview image sohuld show the last connected machine state if a machine is disconnected, or the current state for suspended machines. when a machine is off (not suspended) show the usual preview.

* connect to already running machines. this might mean using a file pipe instead of stdio for communication with the virtual machine.

* passive notification for noncritical errors (maybe in the currently unused status bar area?)

* when qemu supports it, on the fly switching between GUI modes (perhaps using SDL for a faster fullscreen mode)

* multiple hard drives/ optical disks.

* removal and insertion of optical disks and hard drives on the fly.

* inclusion of tools to make the guest os integrate with the host better.
  -copy/paste
  -resolution changing

* USB device support

-------------------
Long Term (3.0?)
-------------------
* a standalone backend with no GUI dependancy. this will run virtual machines on multiple servers with the ability to migrate VMs from one server to another. a QtEmu client can connect to the server to administer and view virtual machines.

* a permissions structure for this backend so only certain authenticated clients can perform certain tasks. multiple levels of permission per machnine.

* assisted OS installation? a system that allows QtEmu to help you install an OS. maybe automatic installation by filling out a form with desired settings and QtEmu fills in the values during installation for popular operating systems.
